## Contributing Guidelines  

Thank you for contributing to this project! To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please follow these guidelines:  

### Branching  

### Branching  

1.  **Create a new branch for yourself Branch names *must* follow the convention
   `dev_<yourname>. Replace `<yourname>` with *your* username or name (e.g., `joshua`, `godwin`)
    For example: `dev_joshua` or `dev_sarah`.  

    ```bash  
    git checkout -b dev_<yourname> 
    ```  

    Remember to replace `<yourname>` with the appropriate values.  We branch from `develop` to keep `main` clean and releasable. The `dev_` prefix helps with branch organization and identification.
     
2.   **Work on your changes within your branch.** Implement your feature or bug fix, and commit your changes regularly with clear and descriptive commit messages.  

    ```bash  
    git add .  
    git commit -m "Detailed description of changes"  
    ```  

3.  **Push your branch to the remote repository.**  

    ```bash  
    git push origin <branch_name>  
    ```  

### Merge Requests (Pull Requests)  

1.  **Once you've completed your work and are ready to merge your changes, create a merge request (or pull request, depending on your Git platform) to the `develop` branch.**  

2.  **Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the merge request.** Explain the problem you're solving, the approach you took, and any potential impacts of your changes.  

3.  **Request a review from one or more team members.** Be responsive to their feedback and address any concerns they raise.  

4.  **After your merge request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.**  

5.  **The `develop` branch will be merged into the `main` branch periodically by the project maintainers, after thorough testing and verification.**  Direct commits to `main` are not allowed.  

### Code Style  

*    Following a consistent code style helps maintain readability and reduces errors, we advicce high quality codes, you are allowed to use any AI Engine but edit your codes and test them to make sure they are clean, usable and functional.
*    Remeber youa re working on a FinTech and there is need to be careful for security and when debiting and or crediting a user.  

### Important Notes  

*   **Always pull the latest changes from the `develop` branch before starting new work.** This helps prevent merge conflicts.  
    ```bash  
    git checkout develop  
    git pull origin develop  
    ```  

*   **Write clear and concise commit messages.** Good commit messages explain *why* you made the changes, not just *what* you changed.  

*   **Be patient and responsive during the review process.**  We're all working together to make this project better!  

By following these guidelines, you can help us maintain a healthy and productive development environment.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!
